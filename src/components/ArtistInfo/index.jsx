          <h2>Lunay, also know as 'El Niño'</h2>
          <h2>Genre: Reggaeton</h2>
          <p>
            Lunay is a Puerto Rican reggaeton artist whose charting collaborations with
             artists such as Daddy Yankee, Anuel AA, Bad Bunny, and Zion & Lennox resulted 
             in him scoring his own recording contract. Born in Puerto Rico in 2000, Lunay 
             was far more interested in soccer than music as a young teen, but he caught the 
             bug at 15. A year later, he was creating freestyle raps and uploading them to 
             his Facebook and SoundCloud pages. Several of his audio clips went viral and 
             caught the attention of producers Chris Jedi and Gaby Music, who signed him to 
             a production deal on their Record Label - La Familia.
